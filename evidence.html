            <h1>Evidence</h1>
            <p>Evidence is what you need to know in order to make better decisions when developing adaptation partnerships and assessing impacts, risks and progress towards a well adapting place. It supports evolving knowledge of what works and tests assumptions embedded in adaptation plans to inform and improve future practice and help design adaptation options. The evidence base should be co-developed and include local knowledge and lived experience as well as more formal data sources. It is vital that the evidence is translated and communicated so that it is relevant and easy to understand. Key aspects include:</p>

            <ul class="fw-bold">
                <li>Co-Developing & Maintaining an Evidence base</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The partnership should focus on co-developing an evidence base in a way that builds trust, supports transparency and includes more than the usual suspects (such as the council, land owners government and larger stakeholders) from the beginning. Local knowledge and lived experience should be valued equally alongside more formal data and evidence from peer reviewed publications and official sources. An evidence base is never “complete” it is like a living thing which some parts need to grow and others need to be maintained, as evidence needs change through time.</p>

            <ul class="fw-bold">
                <li>Communicating & Understanding the Evidence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Evidence is only useful if it is relevant, understandable and useable.  A place-based partnership will have a range of people and organisations involved and they will interact with the evidence in different ways depending on how it impacts on their own work and life, their particular areas of interest and responsibilities, mindsets and the power they have to make decisions.  To bring evidence to life it needs to be translated into knowledge and shared in accessible formats which are useful to the people who need to know about it at that point in time. The partnership should share evidence clearly, openly, and consistently. Cultural and creative practice should be integral to developing and communicating evidence and involving wider society in the changes needed to adapt.</p>

            <ul class="fw-bold">
                <li>Monitoring, evaluating and learning</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important to be able to monitor and evaluate the impact of adaptation plans and progress of places using indicators related to discrete ‘bits’ of evidence gathered, and how it and the processes which shape and interconnect the evidence shift over temporal and spatial scales. Adaptation will require both incremental (small) and systemic changes (transformative and/or holistic changes). To support this the partnership should develop evidence and insights of interactions between climate risks and wider social, economic, and natural systems. Levers of change (Tipping points) and ‘opportunities for collaborative mapping of the system to identify windows of opportunity and levers for change.  This will help to prioritise influencing activities most effectively.</p>

                                <p>This first step is desk-based and is focused on collating existing evidence. At this stage it is a good idea to connect and build relationships with researchers and those who hold evidence within their organisations - often folk are happy to help and share the evidence and insights that they hold. You might also be able to form collaborations with research partners and benefit from student projects to support this work.  You might have some time to do this yourself or you might commission someone else to gather the data for you such as a consultancy or as a research project.</p>

                                    <li>Environmental - e.g.: weather data & models, biodiversity records, habitat & geological mapping, flooding and erosion historical data and predictions (including the data needed)</li>

                                    <li>Political - what relevant governmental policies (local & national) are in place already? How much budget is available for Climate Action and especially in relation to Climate Risk and Adaptation? Land use designations including areas for development & natural protection designations, Legislation and pledges.</li>
                                    <li>Cultural.  Mapping cultural heritage assets, Surveys for example what people connected to the place value the most and why?</li>

                                <p>There can also be different scales of evidence in terms of spatial relevance and also temporal - when and where were the data collected? Have they been repeated?

                                <p>This is an opportunity to build a shared evidence base that the partners jointly own and can use to inform decision making and action. This will build on the evidence collected in the desk-based study and identify the priorities within your place and will identify data needed to understand the impact of potential solutions and inform decision making. Exploring specific problems facing a place helps to develop a deeper understanding of how to increase resilience and what evidence is needed and available.</p>

                                <p><span class="fw-bold">Facilitate discussions</span> - A starting point for codeveloping the evidence base is to present existing evidence (Evidence Action 1A) and facilitate a workshop/ conversation/ set of interviews to begin discussing how the place is being impacted by climate change. Map based activities where participants describe their experiences of local impacts can be very powerful as are used in many existing supporting toolkits including NI Adapts and the Outer Hebrides community planning project (See resources below).</p>

                                <p>The LCLIP and BACLIAT tools also include workshops which will support the co-development of the evidence base and Impact interview templates and examples of community mapping.</p>

                                <p>This process brings in lived experience and helps people become familiar with the evidence - builds shared understanding among partners and enables those who are not climate change experts to connect and contribute. The benefit of shared evidence base is that all partners have access to consistent, co-developed evidence. This reduces duplication of effort and results in economies of scale.</p>

                                <p><span class="fw-bold">Define who needs to be involved</span> - Stakeholders are all those who need to be considered in achieving the well adapting place vision and whose participation and support are crucial to its success. (See stakeholder mapping in Resource action 1C and vision in Leadership action 1C). Co-development working with stakeholders in both the development of the vision, collation of the evidence, and design and implementation, is a key to - but not a guarantee of - success.</p>

                                    It is also vital to start thinking about how you will monitor and evaluate any change and what data changes you could track as Indicators (SEE 2BE).

These include: the mindset in the people involved; culture, knowledge management systems, opportunities for reflection in processes, tailoring and application of evidence for specific purposes. Looking outward for promising practices and reflection on internal practice can be useful, including the more tacit stuff that is often not written down and is generally passed through relationships. Therefore; it is important to build in opportunities for groups to meet and share practice and progress (as has been the case with the TalX project)</p>

                                <p>Setting a Data Repository Sharing agreement and ownership of data can help in ensuring good working practices within the place. Governments involved in the World Meteorological Organisation (193 Countries) have agreed to exchange climate and weather data freely since the World Meteorological Congress in 2021.</p>

                                <p>
                                    There are international data repositories for Climate Data such as
                                    <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home"
                                       target="_blank">https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home</a>
                                    and

                                    however it is useful to bring together local data for a place in a transparent sharable way.

                                    One way of strengthening the usability of the evidence base is to develop case studies which provide real world examples and stories which aid in the communication of understanding potential problems and solutions. There are multiple examples of case studies within this toolkit but there are also more here:

                                <p>Co-developing the risk assessment framework ensures that there is transparency around the understanding of priority climate risks and actions needed to reduce their impact and take advantage of any opportunities, in relation to the people and organisations involved in developing a well adapting place ensuring that vulnerabilities are also considered.</p>

                                <p>This is a significant stage of work and can be very time and resource intensive as it needs to be co-developed.  This includes using published research, data and analytics alongside local knowledge and lived experience to create a shared evidence based that can be used to develop adaptation plans and actions.</p>

                                <p><span class="fw-bold">Focus on codesign of the expanded evidence base</span> - develop collaborations with those who can support you to build the evidence base, work with stakeholders to ensure that any new evidence is decision relevant and scope out the work required to develop the evidence.</p>

                                <p>This is building on your baseline evidence gathered in stage 1 and starting to prioritise what evidence needs to be gathered first and how to commission it.  This will also link to funding priorities and deciding what work needs to be commissioned or developed in house.</p>

                                    What are Climate Scenarios?<br>
                                    Climate change scenarios are a powerful tool for understanding climate change, charting response strategies, and supporting climate policy making. Climate change scenarios are not about predicting the future but come in the form of projections of what can happen or pathways of how to reach certain goals. Climate change scenarios are usually used in pairs or larger sets which determine their context and meaning.
