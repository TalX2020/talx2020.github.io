            <h1>Leadership</h1>
            <p>The establishment of many adaptation partnerships is driven by visionary leadership; leadership which is
                innovative, imaginative, and inspires and empowers others. Over time, many different forms of leadership
                are required. By developing this capability, you can help to sustain and increase impact over the long
                term.</p>
            <p>Key aspects include:</p>

            <ul class="fw-bold">
                <li>Vision</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The challenge of adapting to climate change needs to be well understood by partners who must have the
                vision, drive and determination needed to lead change. The partnership needs visionary leadership and a
                clear and ambitious vision and purpose to motivate and inspire involvement and action.</p>

            <ul class="fw-bold">
                <li>Empowerment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Authentic and heartfelt leadership is needed to empower and motivate inclusive action. Adaptation should
                be developed with people and nature, rather than done to them and must take account of wider challenges,
                opportunities, and priorities.</p>

            <ul class="fw-bold">
                <li>Influence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The partnership will need to take a strategic approach to developing influence. Techniques such as
                stakeholder analysis and power mapping can help to scope targeted engagement and influencing.
                Identifying windows of opportunity and levers of change helps to focus effort to influence change,
                including through policy and legal drivers. </p>

                                <p>Creating a shared vision can help partners to explore the change that they want to
                                    achieve together and develop a shared view on what they want and need for the future
                                    of their place.</p>
                                <p>The visioning process should be open, transparent, creative and inclusive. It is an
                                    opportunity to bring together diverse stakeholders, build relationships and identify
                                    areas of consensus and potential conflict. Creating a shared vision can help open up
                                    conversations about how the changes set out in the vision can be achieved, build
                                    social and political support for change and lay the foundation for positive actions
                                    in the future. This action is connected to the partnership capability as it helps
                                    develop relationships and builds trust between stakeholders through exploring and
                                    communicating shared challenges and hopes for the future.</p>

                                        during the visioning process. This activity is strongly connected to building

                                        Leaders tend to emerge during and after crisis events and look to collaborate

                                        legislation can be powerful opportunities to influence climate resilience and
                                        adaptation. Review existing strategies to identify systemic barriers that may
                                        hinder advancement (e.g. particular types of adaptation solutions that might not
                                        align with the vision). Identify government policies and mandates that require
                                        the consideration of climate change and align plans and strategies with these to
                                        secure buy-in and support from central and local authorities. Look out for
                                        ‘windows of opportunity’ to influence changes in legislation and policy that can
                                        help progress adaptation actions.

                                <p>In the early stages of adaptation partnerships stakeholders often respond well to
                                    visionary leadership from passionate individuals who ‘practise what they preach’. As
                                    the partnership begins to expand, leadership styles that are more inclusive with
                                    regards to decision-making (Democratic, Pacesetter, Transformational) become more
                                    important in driving change.</p>
                                <p>Top-down leadership styles, which tend to be more autocratic or bureaucratic, are
                                    thought to be less successful and sustainable.</p>

                                <p>Effective adaptation needs a ‘bigger picture’ outlook. Having a long-term vision that
                                    includes cross-sectoral and multi-level linkages will allow for multiple benefits
                                    from adaptation action while also embedding adaptation as a key priority within the
                                    place.</p>
                                <p>Leaders can help different partners understand why adapting to climate change is
                                    relevant for them and can help create open and inclusive spaces where people can
                                    work together to explore how and why adaptation connects to their wider social,
                                    economic, and environmental concerns and priorities. New leaders can emerge from
                                    these discussions and partners can be motivated to create and advocate for policies
                                    and investments that take account of local needs, support equal and just adaptation
                                    and deliver maximum benefit.</p>
                                <p>This action ties in closely with the partnership capability in the need for
                                    stakeholders to work together for systems change and transformation to occur.</p>

                                        - To sustain success a ‘bigger picture’ view of adaptation is needed. The vision
                                        that partners developed initially (stage 1) should be a key communication
                                        resource that leaders can use to build buy in and support for action. The vision
                                        may also be further developed into a strategic planning tool by applying a
                                        theory of change approach (see partnership capability action 2B).<br>
                                        Policies should have explicit adaptation outcomes for resilient futures, not
                                        just current resilience. Support this by developing objectives to meet the
                                        long-term vision for the place, and update them as adaptation progresses. This
                                        activity is strongly connected to the governance of an adaptation partnership.

                                <p>In place-based adaptation initiatives there comes a critical point where those

                                    on-the-ground action to begin. Support from stakeholders is instrumental to
                                    implementing the vision, while support from central government can also be helpful.
                                    Use monitoring and evaluation to highlight learnings from both successes and
                                    failures in the adaptation process and continually strengthen it. Communicate
                                    progress and learnings from adaptation initiatives to instil a sense of ownership in
                                    communities and foster positive relationships with central government (increasing
                                    the likelihood of future buy-in for adaptation action).</p>

                                        champions.

                                        your place) to promote the co-benefits of adaptation actions, or involving less
