            <h1>Resource</h1>

            <p>
                Investment in a partnership approach can leverage significant added value and additional resources. By
                developing this capability, you can achieve economies of scale, avoid duplication of effort and benefit
                from diverse skills and expertise. You can also build a strong case for securing new resources to build
                partnership working and deliver joint adaptation projects.
            </p>

            <p>Key aspects include:</p>

            <ul>
                <b>
                    <li>People</li>
                </b>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The partnership should include people from diverse backgrounds, including under-represented groups and
                put steps in place to ensure they are valued and can contribute actively. You will need people who can
                support, lead and co-ordinate activities and also people who can provide specific knowledge such as
                local knowledge, risk assessment, data and analytics or funding and finance expertise.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <b>
                    <li>Assets and Communication Resources</li>
                </b>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Sharing assets such as data, technology and communication resources will enable the partnership to go
                further, faster. Where appropriate, large scale adaptation projects or assets such as hazard warning
                systems, blue and green infrastructure or coastal adaptation measures can be jointly owned, managed or
                developed.
            </p>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Setting up, leading, and coordinating partnerships requires significant time and effort. Some
                partnerships are run by volunteers who give significant amounts of time. In many cases funding will be
                required to pay for staff time, and partners will need to make a strong case for funding co-ordination
                of the partnership. Many adaptation partnerships have a remit to deliver specific projects and
                initiatives and need to identify funding sources and develop funding models that draw in public, private
                and third sector finance.

                                    Climate change is a wicked problem. This means that a diverse skill set across
                                    sectors, backgrounds and experiences is needed to adapt. A key element of an
                                    effective adaptation partnership is the identification, development and
                                    implementation of relevant skills and capabilities.
                                </p>

                                        <b>Identify the existing resources</b>
                                        that partners have access to. This includes the finance, volunteers, staff and
                                        assets that are available to be redirected or modified to support adaptation.
                                        This can be supported by mapping out existing budgets, projects and skills. A
                                        competency assessment may help identify existing skills and competencies.
                                        Assessments may be self or manager assessments to identify individual strengths
                                        and weaknesses.

                                        partnership will benefit from having a diverse range of skills, experience and
                                        leadership. Where partners include major organisations, it is important to
                                        acknowledge that climate change is not just the responsibility of one team but
                                        needs involvement and support across departments and levels of management.

                                        Skills development within organisations can be supported by continuous
                                        professional development - ensure adaptation competencies are identified within
                                        role profiles and are supported within individuals’ professional development
                                        plans. Adaptation skills sets include managerial, technical and participatory.
                                        For example:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Managerial - Management skills include strategic leadership, financial
                                                management, conflict management, visioning, creating and inspiring,

                                                management and reporting skills. Management skills are needed to build
                                                an enabling environment, support identification and securing resources
                                                as well as making sure results are achieved and monitored and evaluated.

                                                cooperation, ownership and action. This supports the development of
                                                welcoming and engaging environment where diverse stakeholders feel
                                                comfortable voicing their opinion.

                                    - There is significant amount of work associated with a climate adaptation
                                    partnership. Whilst successful volunteer led partnerships do exist, these rely on
                                    significant volunteer time and support. In many cases a dedicated coordinator role
                                    is needed to lead the secretariat, support delivering, build relationship and
                                    leverage additional investment. Work should be undertaken to make the case for
                                    funding a dedicated coordinator position in line with member organisation’s
                                    requirements and processes. This can be part of the wider business case development

                                    Adaptation is inherently local and therefore needs to be locally relevant. Steps to
                                    understand the ‘place’ will be key to informing work programming and tailoring
                                    communication. Early action should be undertaken to highlight organisations and
                                    groups who may be able to contribute resource, as well as identifying those who may
                                    be most in need of such resources.

                                        Systemic injustice and oppression may create barriers for individuals,
                                        communities and systems to adapt. There is a need to identify these injustices
                                        (and their causes) so that they may be addressed within adaptation action
                                        planning and resourcing. Part of this is understanding where and who is most at

                                    collaboration and delivery is pivotal. By developing and funding a coordinator
                                    position, the partnership will be supported by a key individual / have a clear focal
                                    point.

                                        picture and the finer details of adaptation and support the development of
                                        partnerships. Members should identify options for resourcing a co-ordinator
                                        role. These options should be implemented to secure the funding required. New
                                        staff may need to be recruited or this could be about identifying relevant staff
                                        to take forward this position. A key aspect of this role involves developing new
                                        resources - for example bringing in project funding and research collaborations.
                                        The role should therefore deliver a high return on investment for partners by
                                        leveraging in significant additional resources.

                                        There is a need to recognise that different partners will provide different
                                        types and levels of resourcing. Community and third sector leaders may have
                                        fewer resources available to contribute and the partnership should collectively
                                        provide support to enable their involvement – for example by providing funding
                                        to cover time and expenses related to participation in partnership decision

                                        - confirm priorities, map opportunities based on goals and requirements, screen
                                        the project lists, categorise and package according to adaptation type,
                                        financial needs, funding requirements. Consider clustering small projects into
                                        components of a larger project to leverage funding. Projects may be bundled
                                        based on geography, project type, or hazard they are responding to , in order to
                                        create economies of scale. Bundling projects in this way can help improve
                                        eligibility for funding, attract increased diversity of investors, support
                                        cost-sharing, result in lower project development costs and mitigate financial
                                        risk. The Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance have also produced guidance

                                        impact by pooling resources or creating blended financing. Intermediaries who
                                        can support this include green banks, national banks etc (America Adapts).
