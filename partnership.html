            <h1>Partnership</h1>

            <p><span class="fw-bold">Partnership is a decision to work together. Itâ€™s not easy but the rewards are worth it.</span>
                Adaptation partnerships have a crucial role to play in locally led, fair and just adaptation. By
                developing this capability, you will create the conditions needed for people to work together
                effectively. Key aspects include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="fw-bold">Create a healthy culture</li>
                <p>Partnerships with a healthy culture are built on trust and shared understanding. They share power and
                    influence fairly, and enable partners to contribute fully and equally. Conflict and emotion are
                    acknowledged and addressed as an opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li class="fw-bold">Build strong governance and supporting structures</li>
                <p>Governance and structures are in place to provide a clear process for decision making,
                    accountability, roles, and responsibilities. They evolve as the partnership develops and matures
                    over time and should enable rather than restrict change.</p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li class="fw-bold">Collaborate</li>
                <p>Effective partnerships focus on collaboration and co-development. They create inclusive spaces where
                    partners and wider stakeholders can actively contribute to establish the case for a place-based
                    adaptation partnership, agree ways of working and build a strong set of actions.</p>

                                <p>Place-based adaptation initiatives often begin through informal discussions that take
                                    place among a small group of individuals.</p>

                                <p>Sometimes people are motivated to develop place-based adaptation initiatives after
                                    one or more trigger events, for example repeated severe weather events, or a major
                                    issue affecting the community, for example coastal erosion affecting homes or
                                    transport routes. It is important to be aware of the physical, emotional and
                                    psychological impacts of experiencing trigger events and to be mindful of the
                                    personal challenges that those involved in building these early-stage relationships
                                    may be experiencing.</p>

                                <p>Other times place based adaptation initiatives are set up proactively because
                                    partners recognise that the place faces multiple climate risks and that there are
                                    clear benefits to addressing these in a joined-up way.</p>

                                <p>At this stage it is important for partners to build positive relationships and
                                    explore if and how they would like to work together. Activities that can support
                                    progress include:</p>

                                <p><span class="fw-bold">Intention setting</span> - The early stage of developing a
                                    place-based adaptation partnership is an important opportunity to set intentions for
                                    the future. Developing a systematic and shared understanding of enablers of change
                                    can help partners plan how to progress adaptation and support the case for change.
                                </p>

                                <p> The Traction project sets out a framework for advancing climate change adaptation
                                    action and includes a set of questions that place based partnerships can use to help
                                    set intentions for the future. Setting and documenting intentions at an early stage
                                    provides a strong foundation for evaluating progress and learning as the partnership
                                    begins to operate.</p>

                                <p><span class="fw-bold">Business case/ case for change</span> - Establishing a
                                    place-based adaptation partnership or initiative is a big commitment. Compiling a
                                    case for change or business case document can help partners to make a final decision
                                    on whether to progress with establishing a partnership and working together over the
                                    long term.</p>

                                <p>The process for developing the case for change or business case should be open and
                                    transparent. You can lay the groundwork for building towards system change and
                                    transformation by adopting a co-design process that enables stakeholders to work
                                    through their preferences for the partnership and develop an approach that is fair
                                    and represents their shared views and priorities.</p>

                                <p>Interviews, surveys and workshops can be used to explore specific challenges and
                                    priorities and can also explore potential levers of change. This can be quite a
                                    messy and wide-ranging process; it should go beyond the usual technical stakeholders
                                    (e.g. climate change experts) and include new and different voices. Feedback can be
                                    pulled together and used to create a to a business case document, support funding
                                    bids and/ or develop a detailed work programme for the partnership.</p>

                                    - Governments and major institutions around the world have begun to adopt eight
                                    principles for locally-led adaptation. The principles were developed by a
                                    partnership of peers, formed under the
                                    <a href="https://www.wri.org/our-work/project/global-commission-adaptation"

                                <p><span class="fw-bold">Collaborative governance</span> - Adaptation partnerships that
                                    hope to drive system change and transformation are likely to require collaborative
                                    governance. This form of governance involves multiple actors including citizens and
                                    major organisations working together on an ongoing basis. It involves moving away
                                    from more traditional, hierarchical, public sector or public-private partnerships
                                    and creating space for communities and citizens to be actively involved and have
                                    influence over decision making. Collaborative governance shifts the emphasis away
                                    from consulting with communities to deeply involving communities in different ways
                                    throughout decision making.</p>

                                <p>The power dynamics involved with collaborative governance are complicated and often
                                    shift over time. Managing this type of approach requires facilitatory leadership and
                                    long-term relationship building (see Leadership Action 1C). It relies upon
                                    participants committing to a process of dialogue and deliberation - using creative
                                    and innovative approaches to exploring different perspectives and reaching
                                    decisions.</p>

                                <p>The rewards of collaborative governance are potentially huge. By bringing different
                                    people together, building trust and addressing imbalances in power and influence
                                    partnerships can come up with new and different opportunities and solutions.</p>

                                    <li>Discuss the ways of working that are acceptable to partners. There can be the
                                        expectation that citizens and communities will adapt to the working practices of
                                        public institutions when in practice this may not be the case. It is important
                                        to create a space where partners can share different views and preferences and
                                        work through a process of dialogue and deliberation where they can reach
                                        agreement on how partners will work together.

                                    principles and a partnership model can be messy and challenging. Learning to mediate
                                    and resolve the tensions and conflicts that may arise at this stage is a valuable
                                    learning experience for partners. Handled thoughtfully and sensitively it is an
                                    opportunity to build trust and experience that will help the partnership navigate

                                    relationships) are analysed, mapping the influence and the exchange of information
                                    to assess adaptive capacity. This explores socio-institutional processes, and

                                <p>Working in partnership should enable you to achieve much more together than you can
                                    achieve alone.</p>

                                <p>Your commitment to developing a strong, healthy and dynamic partnership should result
                                    in progressive, impactful and transformative actions that achieve clear benefits.
                                    Targets and monitoring and evaluation should be included in the action planning
                                    process.</p>

                                <p><span class="fw-bold">Co-design actions</span> - Actions should be co-designed with
                                    stakeholders and should build on earlier work to set intentions, develop the
                                    evidence base, map out the changes that the partnership is working towards, identify
                                    levers of change and develop resourcing options. Securing commitment and investment
                                    will require consensus building, influencing and work to develop the business case
                                    for individual and collective actions.</p>

                                <p class="mb-0"><u>Examples of adaptation action categories:</u></p>
                                <p>Adaptation actions should be developed based on the unique culture, context, and
                                    risks faced by different places. As the partnership works towards transformational
                                    change, it is likely to develop a range of actions which include incremental actions
                                    as well as actions that seek to alter existing systems and ways of doing things. A
                                    portfolio of activities that span multiple scales and systems can collectively
                                    contribute towards addressing the root causes of climate risks and influence
                                    transformation. This is likely to be a messy process because influencing system
                                    change is complex, non-linear process.</p>

                                <p>The scope of adaptation actions adaptation partnerships commit to will develop over
                                    time as partners build trust and gain skills and experience.</p>

                                    funding that can be accessed.</p>

                                <p>You may wish to form a sub group to explore options for further strengthening the
                                    partnership. It is important that this process is open and transparent and that the
                                    group focuses on identifying the best arrangements for the partnership as a whole
                                    rather than prioritising the needs of individual partners.</p>

                                    The Climate Ready Clyde initiative published a transformative adaptation Strategy
                                    and Action Plan in 2021 and has recently completed a process of developing new
                                    operating arrangements - an overview of their updated governance structure and
                                    operating principles is available here:

                                <p>By this stage the partnership will be focused on implementing ambitious, locally led
                                    adaptation actions. The pressure is on to deliver the actions that partners
                                    committed to.</p>

                                <p>
                                    <span class="fw-bold">Working effectively in partnership to deliver ambitious actions will require a fundamentally different way of working</span>
                                    - breaking down internal and sectoral silos and building a strongly collaborative
                                    approach, and willingness to experiment.
                                </p>

                                <p>Securing resources for adaptation actions, either embedded within broader projects or
                                    as standalone activities requires significant expertise, relationship building and
                                    influence. The resource capability provides links to resources and case studies
                                    exploring opportunities for funding adaptation actions</p>

                                <p>There are also very strong connections to leadership. Leaders within your partnership
                                    will need to champion the adaptation actions that have been agreed and push for them
                                    to be implemented, ensuring that they are retained within project and investment
                                    planning cycles. It is also important to celebrate and communicate success when
                                    project milestones are reached and benefits delivered.</p>

                                <p>It is important to demonstrate how the projects, actions and activities that you are

                                    adaptive capacity. Indicators should be identified to enable you to identify if
                                    climate risks are reducing or increasing. There are a wide range of example

                                <p>Monitoring and evaluation is an integral element of theory of change processes that
                                    identify how change happens. Where a theory of change has been developed monitoring,
                                    evaluation and learning should include reflecting on the change process, including
                                    questioning what has changed as a result of your specific projects or intervention.
