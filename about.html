            With a focus on supporting place-based adaptation across the UK and Ireland, the framework co-developed
            through the EPA-funded Transboundary Adaptation Learning Exchange (TalX) project will provide a roadmap to:

            <strong>What makes a quality partnership?</strong><br>
            The TalX framework focuses on four key priority capabilities (Leadership, Evidence, Partnership, Resource).
            For each capability three stages of maturity were identified (Stage 1, 2, 3), from basic to advanced. and
            actions to support adaptation partnerships to advance through each stage of maturity provided.
        </p>

        <p>
            For each capability there are three core elements that are representative of that capability:
